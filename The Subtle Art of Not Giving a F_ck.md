# The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck

## Chap 1: Don't Try

- A confident man doesn't feel a need to prove that he's confident. A rich woman doesn't feel a need to convince anyone that she's rich
- "The problem is that **giving too many fucks is bad for your mental health**" => overly attached to chasing the superficial and fake, a mariage of happiness and satisfaction
- "The key to a good life is not giving a fuck about more; it's **giving a fuck about less, giving a fuck about only what is true and immediate and important**"
- It may help to accept that the world is totally fucked up and that's all right, because it's always been that way
- <ins>**Most of us struggle throughout our lives by giving too many fucks in situations where fucks don't deserve to be given**</ins>
- You can't be a life-changing & important presence for some people without being a joke and embarrassment for others

> Be selective about the fucks you given

> Learn how to focus and prioritize your thoughts. Pick what matters to you

## Chap 2: Happiness Is a Problem

- **As with being rich, there's no value in suffering when it's done without purpose**
- Pain and suffering is inevitable but it's not all equal
- Suffering may be one of nature's preferred agents for inspiring change
- There will always be problems. Happiness comes from solving them. Action. Some people are in denial or have victim mentality
- **What are you willing to sacrifice to become happy?** Eg, new office => longer hours, good relationships => more time with friends, strong physique => gym endurance
- You have to face the problem

> call to action

> reward <=> struggle, result <==> process

## Chap 3: You are not Special

- Most of us are pretty average at most things we do, even if you're exceptional at one thing. **To become truly great at something, you have to dedicate a lot of time to it**
- The vast majority of life is unexceptional, average, which is different from the media. eg, cool => party, popular => sex, etc.

## Chap 4: The Value of Suffering
- Blindly suffering is pointless; but suffering in order to achieve something meaningful is worthwhile. So when suffering, ask, *"Why am I suffering - for what purpose?"*
- **We all evaluate ourselves against others. The question is: by what standards?" Metrics can change**. (eg, Dave and Beatles, whether more popular than another band). How we measure ourselves come from values. Bad values:
	- pleasure
	- material success (eg, self-worth depends on money mode)
	- popularity
	- dominance
- Good values are reality-based and controllable. Eg, integrity, innovativeness. 
- **Good values are achieved internally; bad values are usually outside of our control. When we have poor values, we're essentially giving fucks over things that don't matter**
- What are my values -> Priorities to give a fuck about
	- What am I willing to sacrifice to achieve these values?
	- Metrics of success, and internal scorecard 
	
## Chap 5: You are always Choosing

- A problem that's painful vs empowering depends on whether we chose it or it is forced onto us. eg, running marathon
- **If you're miserable, that's likely because there's a problem outside of your control that's affecting you**
- Fault (blame) and responsibility are different. We can be responsible for something without being at fault
- How we choose to respond is up to us. Responsibility, like Slight Edge

## Chap 6: You're Wrong About Everything

- Failure and uncertainty
- Growth is an iterative process; we go from wrong to slightly less wrong
- Many people become so obsessed with being "right" about their lives that they never end up living it
- It's natural to be wrong and doubt and feel uncertain
- **Don't let money and your jobs define your lives**
- **The more something threatens your identity, the more liekly you would avoid it. This is why some people are afraid of success.** There are good important activities that we consistently pass on because they threaten how we see ourselves

> What would it mean if I were wrong?

## Chap 7: Failure is the way Forward

- Improvements usually consists of many tiny failures
- Act despite feeling fear

## Chap 8: The Importance of Saying Not

- Absolute freedom by itself means nothing
- The only way to achieve meaning is through rejection of alternatives => committing to fewer things
- To have values means there are some things we will reject
- When you're pursuing a wide breadth of experience, there are diminishing returns to each new adventure. Eg, hobbies, friends, sex, etc.

## Chap 9: And Then You Die

- **In the inevitability of death, there's no reason to cave in/be blocked by one's fear or embarrassment or shame**
- Confronting the reality of our own mortality is important because it eliminates the superficial crappy values of life
- Some people feel they need to be great to be accepted in a world that broadcasts only the extraordinary
