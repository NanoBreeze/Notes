# Social Psych, 13th Edition

## Chap 1: The Science of the Social Side of Life

- *"Social contact is a central aspect of our lives and in a very basic sense, defines who we are and the **quality of our existence.**"*
- Seeks to understand *how and why* individuals *behave, think, and feel* as they do in social situations
	- understand causes of social behaviour & thought
	- basic principles in a changing world, emotion, relationships
	
> "Relationships are the building blocks of social side of life"

## Chap 2: Social Cognition, how we think about the social world
Most of our thinking proceeds on "automatic", without much careful reasoning, but it is also quite efficient. We often use heuristics - simple rule of humb rules - to make decisions

> "Affect" => current mood and feelings

<ins>Representative Heuristics</ins>: the more an individual matches/resembles a given group, the more likely they are to belong to it. Eg, librarian. 
- Drawback: tends to ignore base rate
- Salient features, probability of event
- Not only for judging people, but also for analyzing cases => similar consequences

<ins>Availability Heuristics</ins>: the more immediate something can be recalled, the more important it is, so it heavily impacts our quick decisions. aka, **the more info we think of, the greater its impact on our judgement**
- Drawback: overestimating events, eg airplane vs car crash

<ins>Anchoring and adjustment Heuristic</ins>: when uncertain, we anchor to something as the starting point and base adjustments off it. Eg, high price

<ins>Status Quo Heuristic</ins>: "What is, is good". People tend to favour status quo over new. Eg, chocolate, painting, accupuncture

<ins>Schemas</ins> are mental frameworks for organizing social information, eg, what to expect in various social situations. Influences:
- attention: schema often acts as a filter, more attention to what fits with the expectation
- encoding: what is remembered. Things that fall outside of schema will be remembered. Eg, prof with magic tricks
- Schemas can also ock us into acting and thinking in ways to create the world we suspect 

> priming and unpriming schemas

> choice overload - too many choices

Two ways of social thought: controlled processing & automatic processing (priming schemas)
People tend to have <ins>optimistic bias</ins> (eg, more likely to...), <ins>overconfidence</ins> (ironically, least competent -> most overconfident, don't know what they don't know), <ins>magical thinking</ins>

- Our current emotions - affect- influence our ways of thinking (cognition)
- Current mood also influence our perception of the world
	- during positing mood, perceive everything better (eg, ppl, ideas, etc.)
	- feel like they understand the world better
	- *mood congruence effect*: current mood filters for confruent actions to be noticed and remembered
	- *mood dependent memory*: current mood => ppl are more likely to remember info acquired while in similar mood. Recall info consistent with the mood
	- happy mood increases creativity
- Cognition also influences affect (though influences feelings). Eg, if we think someone is from another group, we might feel different about them
- **One way to regulate emotions is through thought**

> feelings impact thought, and thought impacts feelings

> It's tough to predict how we would feel about an event that we haven't experienced

## Chap 3: Social Perceptions, Perceiving and Understanding Others

- Questions: when are others truthful, why they do or say certain things, how they feel, predict feelings and actions
- **Mood influences not just thoughts but also behaviour, including non-verbal ones**
- Non-verbal: facial expressions (universal ones include anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise), eye contact, touch

<ins>Attribution</ins>: understanding why someone behaves a certain way
- Attributing to self and to fate: belief in a religion and one or many causes
- *Fundamental attribution error*: the tendency to believe what people do reflects who they are, rather than external circumstances. Eg, dropping things => clumsy, possibly because we focus more on the person than on the surrounding situations
- *Self-serving bias*: attribute positive outcomes to ourselves and negative ones to external events. Eg, good/bad grades. Why? To enhance/protect self-esteem. This is the opposite for depressed people

**Asch found that as soon as two or more traits are understood to belong to someone, they no longer become isolated but form impression of entire person and colour other traits. Salient traits?**

## Chap 4: The Self, Answering the Question "Who Am I"?

Questions: 
- do we have one self or many selves that depend on situations?
- do people experience themselves the same every time or does it depend on context and social comparisons?
- what's the nature of self-esteem?
- who's better at predicting our behaviours: ourselves or people who know ua well?

We sometimes want other people to think of us in specific ways and for them to agree with our own self-vies. **We generally prefer to be with people who verify our views about ourselves**

> *self-verification*: prefer others to see one as one sees oneself

> We can learn more about ourselves through introspection and seeing ourselves from observer's perspective

<ins>Personal vs social spectrum</ins>
- Personal: think of ourselves as unique individuals, self-description emphasize how we're different. Usually *intragroup comparison* with other people in some group. Depends on context of group. Eg, liberal vs conservative
- Social: emphasize what we share with other group members and differentiate from other groups

**Our self-descriptions change depending on whether we think of ourselves as an individual or as a member of a group**. The self aspect that's salient impacts our behaviour and self-perceptions:
1.  relevant to context (eg, fun @ party, hard-working @ work)
2. context makes one feature distinctive (eg, 1 woman in a group of men)
3. traits important to self (eg, social, intelligence, etc.)

- **When we use different selves, we highlight different salient attributes and different actions (eg, scholarly vs social)**
- How others treat us and how we think others will treat us influence what we think
- The desire for a better future self can cause us to forego current activities that are enjoyable but may hinder the future improved self (visualization helps)
- *Many social scientists believe low self-esteem is the root of many social ills*. Eg, depression, bad performance, etc. ) Same with high self-esteem
- We compare ourselves to others because there aren't objective measures. Compare group vs group; individual vs individual. "Downward social comparison and upward social comparison"
- Above-average bias, unrealistic optimism -> higher motivation and persistence

> Ego-depletion: harder to exert self-control on subsequent try than first try. Will need to take a break

Some attribution for negative outcomes are more harmful to self than others: 
1. (worst) Internal, stable in many areas : attributed to aspect of self that's perceived to be unchangeable
2. internal stable in some areas: attribution for prejudice, few situations
3. Internal, unstable in many areas: Eg, bad at math but can get better
4. Internal, unstable in some areas: Eg, bad at baseball but don't have to play often
5. (best) External, unstable: Eg, bad luck I got this prof this semester

Negative stereotypes can hurt people's performance. Eg, remind of bad at math, guy couple not as good at child-raising. Why? Causes anxiety. Some people disidentify from aspects of their stereotypes to alleviate from feeling hurt.

## Chap 5: Attitudes, Evaluating and Responding to the Social World

Attitude: how we evaluate the world, issues, ideas, ppl
- certain, variable
- influence our thoughts: explicit vs implicit (not consciously aware)

> Our actions affect our attitudes. Does consensus affect it?

How do attitudes form?
- Classical conditioning: learning based on association. Unconditional precedes conditional (eg, girls -> beer)
- Instrumental Conditioning: rewards for the right views
	- attitudes followed by positive outcomes tend to be strengthened and repeated and negative outcomes are weakened. Therefore, when we're young, peer influence is less strong, children have same views as parents
	- *"The desire to fit in and be rewarded for holding the same attitude is a powerful motivator for change"*
	- **Attitudes can shift when we enter new social networks**
- Observational learning: learning by exposure to others
	- are we equally likely to adopt others' views or does it depend on our relationship to them? **People often adjust their attitudes to be similar to those who they value and identify with - reference group**. When we identify with a group, we can expect to be influenced by them.
	
<ins>When and why do attitudes influence behaviour</ins>
- Attitude may not always predict behaviour. Eg, restaurant & Chinese. *"Even the most prejudiced people will not always act on their attitudes if there are strong situational pressures not to do so"
- Social context affects attitude-behaviour connection. Older people tend to have more attitude-behaviour consistency

> Attitude Extremity + Attitude Certainty + Personal Experience => Strength of Attitude => Attitudes are accessible => add social context => Attitude-behaviour consistency)

Notes: 
- Attitude extremity is influenced heavily by vested interest, who have more attitude-consistent thoughts and are more salient. Influences immediate impacts vs future. Eg, tuition increase now or later
- Attitude certainty is based on *correctness* (when other do this too => justify attitude) and *clarity* (lack of ambiguity, repetitively stating words increases clarity, as does defending against opposition)
- Personal experiences are strong and are more likely to come to mind

System processing: carefully consider a message. Happens if we have capacity to process: knowledgeable, time to think, important

Heuristic processing: use shortcuts. Eg, "feel good. Therefore, is good". Very effective if used with right cues and the target is distracted

> Messages that don't seem designed to change our attitudes are more effective. Simply knowing a sales pitch is coming will undermine its persuasiveness

> When people perceive hard sells to restrict their freedom, they become motivated to resist

<ins>Cognitive Dissonance</ins>: Holding two contradictory beliefs or actions or attitudes
 - People try to minimize dissonance, by rationalizing why they acted a certain way (justification). Eg, $1 vs $20
 - if can't explain, people's attitudes may change. Eg, less leads to more behaviour changes, trivialize it, focus on other subjects
 
 ## Chap 6: Prejudice and Discrimination
 
 Prejudice: negative motional response based on group membership
 
 Stereotype: believe of what a group is like. Eg, gender stereotype: women are warmer but less competent
 
 "Tokenism" - allowing a few minorities into a group as a symbolic effort. Eg, allowing small percentage of low-status groups to advance to higher status deters collective resistance and leads others in low-status groups to favour individual attempts to overcome barriers

> Token practices maintain the status quo by making women's token representation in organizations appear fair

> The presence of a few successful women can lead other women who don't achieve similar success to believe they only ahve themselves to blame

Motivation for stereotypes: 
- gives feeling of predicting behaviour
- feeling positive about our own group identity 

Prejudice is often about bad feeling. *Whether we act on it or not (discrimination) depends on the perceived norms or acceptability to do so.*
- Anger can exacerbate prejudice
- Prejudice often **comes from perceived threats**
	- threat to self esteem -> retaliate against threat to restore self-esteem
	- Intergroup competition for zero-sum gains
	
- If people were merely categorized into different groups, ingroup loyalty and outgroup discimination may appear. us vs them. Why? Social identity theory says that individual wants to feel positive about the group they're in. Part of our self-esteem comes from our social group membership
- Superordinate goals - desired outcome can only be obtained by working together - can reduce conflict
- Minimizing prejudice: recategorization, more contact, give evidence that ingroup likes outgroup

## Chap 7: Interpersonal Attraction

- How do relationships get started? Why are people attracted to each other in the first place?
- *"Forming and maintaining long-term relationships with others is a central part of our social lives"*
- A strong *desire to affiliate with others* seems to be part of our species. (Everyone has this, even those who claim not to)
	- need for affiliation strength differs
	- external events can temporarily boost or reduce affiliation. Eg, reminder of mortality, natural disaster
	- People in uncomfortable situations desire to be with others also in that than to be left alone
	
How are we attracted to others?
1. *Proximity*: eg, repeated exposure effect: the more times we're exposed to a stimulus, the more favourable our evaluation is. Familiarity => positive affect => familiarity. However, if initial reaction is negative, this can increase dislike.  
2. *Physical Attractiveness*: powerful factor in liking others. Physical attraction is viewed to intelligence, good health, kindness etc. Also influenced by situation. Eg, scarcity
3. *Similarity*: similar attitudes predicted liking, opposites not so much. We tend to like similar people
4. *Liking*: reciprocal liking. and tend to dislike those who think we don't measure up

There are some traits we value in everyone, no matter what kind of relationships we have with them: trustworthiness, cooperativeness, agreableness, extraversion. Other traits depend on the type of relationship.

Relationships are influenced by culture. Early relationships between parents and children influence future interpersonal behaviour
- *Attachment style*: amount of security an individual feels in interpersonal relationships
	- self-esteem (valued, important, loved individual)
	- interpersonal trust
	
> Attachment style is not set in stone and can change over time by life experiences

| Vertical axis is self-esteem (up is high)| Horizontal axis is interpersonal trust (right is high) |
| -------------    | ------------- |
| Dismissive       | Secure        |
| Fearful-avoidant | Pre-occupied  |

Notes: 
- Dismissive: fear genuine relationships because less trust. Might say they don't want relationships but feel they deserve good ones
- Fearful-avoidant: tend to have unhappy relationships or not form a close relationship
- Secure: satisfying, lasting, relationships
- Pre-occupied: want closeness and readily form relationships. Cling to others but expect to be rejected

Many friendships begin due to proximity. Long-term friendships have several important traits: 
- more modesty
- less lying unless designed to make friend feel better
- spend more time together; provide emotional support

Love plays a key role in all our lives and personal happiness
- passionate love, compassionate love
- sternberg's triangle: intimacy, passion, commitment 

Jealousy occurs *when a valued relationship with another person is threatened by a rival, mostly because of a reduction in self-esteem.*

# Chap 8: Social Influence, Changing Others' Behaviour
Social influence: effort to *change* behaviour, attitude, or feelings

<ins>Conformity</ins>: doing what we're expected to do in a given situation. Pressure to behave according to rules and social norms
- We tend to think we are less susceptible to conformity than others even though this may not be true. Introspection illusion. This is because *we underestimate how much others' actions influence us*
- Asch's conformity study: 
	- people may conform even if they know others are wrong
	- even one person breaking from a group has a strong effect
	- public conformity doesn't mean private conformity
- What influences degrees of conformity?
	- Cohesiveness: more we want to belong to a group, the more likely we are to conform
	- Group size: up to 8
	- Norms: but only when one thinks the norm applies to him/her
		
> Some social norms are explicitly. Eg, signs in parks. Others are implicit: eg, no noise in concerts

> Social norms develop because we want to be correct and to be accepted

- Why do people go along with conformity? 1. want to be liked via similarity, 2. want to be right, especially if we are uncertain
- The strong pressure to conform suggests that *people's situations, not personal traits, determine their behaviour*. Whether people go along with their roles depend on whether they identify with the roles
- Going against conformity: 
	- Power: powerful people are less dependent than others for obtaining resources. Take others' perspectives less
	- Sexual attraction: for men because assertiveness and independence is a stereotype
	- Desire to be unique: eg, if told they were exactly average on one activity, they will less likely conform on second activity
	
> Conformity has many good things but can also lead to dangerous effects and atrocities. Eg, Zimbardo experiment

Minorities can also influence majorities (eg, environment, revolution,, etc.)
1. Members must seem consistent in opposition (if divided, less powerful)
2. Must not appear rigid or dogmatic (just saying same thing over and over against doesn't work)
3. If argues for position of current social trend
	
We can also be influenced by others who aren't physically present <ins>based on our mental representation of what they want and how they will evaluate our actions</ins>
- Relational schemas, and goals associated with them. Eg, friend -> helpful
- trigger goals that person is associated with

Milgram: why do people obey even though obedience would cause hurt?
1. Transfer of responsibility (eg, to authority)
2. Visible signs of status (eg, uniform or lab coat)
3. Gradual escalation (foot in the door)
4. Fast pace, little time to think 

Reduction techniques:
1. Remember that you are still responsible
2. Reminder that beyond some point, total submission is inappropriate
3. Question expertise and motive of those in authority

## Chap 9: Prosocial Behaviour

<ins>Prosocial Behaviour</ins>: actions that help others with no immediate benefit to the helper

Why do people help others even at costs to themselves when they aren't required to do so?
1. It feels good to help others. Empathy-altruism
2. Reduce our own negative emotions. Not about empathy but about relieving unhappiness. Negative-state relief
3. Feedback. Helpers want to receive positive feedback, want positive impact on others
4. Increase status. Competitive altruism. Eg, donating to schools
5. Defensive helping. Help outgroups that pose a status threat to reduce threat, especially in ways that make them seem dependent on the help => incompetent => less threat

There are three types of empathy: 
1. Emotional empathy: sharing/take perspective of feelings and emotions of others
2. Empathic concern: feeling of concern for another's well-being
3. Empathic accuracy: perceive others' thoughts and feelings (mind-reading)

Bystander effect => diffusion of responsibility. Although in-groups are more likely to receive help than outgroups. Under what situations do bystanders help?
1. Notice that something is unusual
2. Interpreting it as an emergency. If there are many people, increases embarrassment if wrong so less likely to help
3. Deciding it's your responsibility to help
4. Capable/know how to help
5. Deciding to help (can be inhibited by fears. Eg, danger)

> Pluralistic ignorance: when uncertain, look to others. If no one acts, then also less likely to act

Factors that influence helping:
- people we like. Eg, similarity
- people who aren't responsible for their problems. We are less likely to help if we believe the victim is to blame
- Exposure to prosocial events
- Thankful (when helpers are thanked, they are more likely to do it again)

> Sometimes, being in a good mood can decrease probability of helping because they don't recognize the emergency or don't want to do something to detract from good mood

- The tendency to perform prosocial activities increases with exposure to others doing it
- It's easier to have empathy for people in your ingroup => more likely to help, than outgroup => disregard
- Social exclusion decreases empathy
- Sometimes, the self-esteem of those who are helped suffer, especially if they are already in lower status as it suggests they're dependent on others. 

## Chap 10: Aggression

Aggression: Behaviour directed towards the goal of harming another.

Why does aggression happen?
- Biological factors (eg, evolutionary)
- Social learning: learn aggression through direct exposure or observation
	- ways to harm; which group are appropriate to harm
	- what actions justify retaliation; what contexts make aggression acceptable
- General aggression model: situational (eg, frustration, provocation) & personal (beliefs about aggression)

Aggression doesn't come from just a single factor but many: 
- <ins>Direct provocation</ins>: especially if it were meant to hurt us. Condescending, unjustified criticism on person instead of behaviour, action that threaten our reputation/status or self-identity
- <ins>Excitation Transfer Theory</ins>: past events amplify current annoyance. The arousal of one event takes time to dissipate and will persist even after we mote to a different situation. Eg, angry at driver => future small annoyance become amplified. If the arounsal is properly attributed, aggression is decreased
- <ins>Social exclusion</ins>: if people don't want us around => undesirable characteristics activates cognitive structures to perceive neutral as hostil

> Frustration doesn't always lead to aggression. Aggression doesn't always come from frustration. 

Some cultural factors - culture of honour- suggest that aggression is required under certain circumstances. Eg, in Japan
- Jealousy
- Culture expectation: man => aggressive, especially when manhood is challenged to reduced threat 

> Media - people exposed to violence are more likely to become violent themselves because of a) desensitization, which causes less physiological response, and b) activates cognitive processes related to aggression

> Jealousy is often associated with betrayal & anger

People with higher narcissism (excessive love of self. Eg, "The world would be better if I ruled it") react with more aggression when their ego is threatened. This is because it puts their self-image in danger. Too much ego-boosting isn't good.

Bullying: one person repetitively assaults others who have little ability to retaliate. They do this to:
- hold power over others
- be part of a group that's "tough", therefore, high status
- counter negative emotions of depression

## Chap 11: Groups and Individuals, the Consequences of Belonging

Occupational identities can be important to people. Eg, student, engineer, psych

<ins>Group</ins>: people who say themselves as part of a coherent unit
- common-bond: eg, friend group, work teams, sports teams
- common-identity: eg, gender, nationality

Cohesive groups have the following properties:
- members interact with each other often
- group is important to members
- members share common goal
- members are similar in important ways

Highly cohesive groups can influence their members. Key components:
- status: high status => more advantage. People with high status are more variable
- roles: can be acquired informally. In many groups, there's usually a "good listener" to take care of everyone's emotional needs and someone to "get things done". If we internalize our roles, they affect how we see ourselves, who we identify with, and our actions and normals
- norms: implicit rules about what is expected
- cohesiveness: have solidatry, support in groups, co-operate, achieve group goals. Presence of outgroup or threats increase cohesion. Eg, perceiving in-group's future to be in jeopardy 

> Violating group norms can cause dislike from those who highly value the group

> "Most of us put effort to get into and maintain membership in a group"

The benefits of joining groups:
- gain self-knowledge: membership tells us what kind of person we are
- help reach goals, which we might not be able to reach on our own. Eg, high status. 
- Because of cognitive dissonance, if the cost to get membership is high, commitment to a group after joining tends to be higher. Our attitudes change because we had put in more effort. 
- Rejection from a group can have more harmful effects in people with high anxiety or who fear rejection
- One reason for leaving groups is that enough subset of a group has changed to no longer be identified with it. This causes emotional distress, less group identification, and may not feel their voice can be heard

<ins>Social facilitation</ins>: In presences of others, our behaviour changes. Improve performance of things we're good at and decrease not good at

<ins>Social loafing</ins>: People exert less effort when working in a group than when compared to working alone. To reduce social loafing, make each member's output easily identifiable, having a standard, creating pressure, and task impact 

Fairness in groups:
- Distributive justice: about outcome, rewards should be divided in accordance to contributions. Higher contributions => higher rewards
- Procedural Fairness: procedures apply to everyone; errors can be corrected; decision makers avoid being influenced by self-interest
- Transaction fairness: the way we are informed about decisions

> If we don't have full knowledge, we use our feelings to base our judgement. If it feels good => fair, bad => unfair

## Chap 12: Dealing with Adversity and Living Happily

Loneliness has bad consequences. Usually, the more groups we belong to, the happier we feel
- Attachment styles: especially fearful-avoidant or dismissive styles
- not developing social skills

Factors: genetics, parent-child interactions, social learning experiences
Consequences: 
- Negative Affect: eg, anxiety, unhappiness, feeling unappreciated
- Negative Cognitions: eg, self-blame, pessimism
- Negative Behaviour: eg, shyness, avoidance of relationships

> Loneliness is harmful to our physical and psychological well-being

Without some form of intervention to improve social skills, interpersonal difficulties continue throughout adulthood, they don't just go away. Just as how people can be taught engineering and table manner, they can also be taught social skills:
- In romantic relationships, commitment based on positive rewards is more effective than fear of being alone
- Similarity and assumed similarity
- Attachment style: pre-occupied & fearful-avoidant have less satisfying relationships than secure or dismissive style.

Why do relationships end?
- Problems between partners. Eg, negative traits become less and less tolerable, minor flaws that once were acceptable became perceived as intolerable
- perceiving love or approval to be continent on success. Partners expect the other will be loving and kind only when they are successful. People with low0esteem feel this way and would feel less accepted. People with high-esteem don't feel this way. This is an examples where personal failure spills over to relationships

Behaviours that enhance relationships:
- aim to be positive or provide constructive criticism. Those who only focus on being positive show faster declines in satisfaction
- IT'S NOT GOOD if each partner expects to receive something back from the other equivalent to what they're contributing. Instead, aim for communal approach of meeting other's needs, rather than balancing exchanges

Social support (feel cared and loved) reduces stress. Pets are a good source.

> *"People who experience high levels of stress are much more likely to become ill"*. Stress can upset our internal chemistry

Personal happiness: global life satisfaction, satisfaction with important life domains, frequency of positive feelings, negative feelings
- good social relations, having goals and resuorces to achieve them
- wealth is not associated with positive feelings, can reduce our savouring of pleasure. Relative judgements apply here 
- happiness 
	- can do higher quality work
	- higher quality relationships, more social support
	- better health, live longer
	
	Increasing happiness:
	1. Start an upwards spiral
	2. Build close personal relationships
	3. Build personal skills that contribute to it
	4. Stop doing counter-productive things
