# Barking Up the Wrong Tree

## Chap 1: Should we play it safe and do what we're told if we want to be successful?

- Schools have clear rules for winning. What are the rules of the game of life?
- Some traits, in some environments, are bad; in others, good. eg, Churchill
- If you're more of an unfiltered type, be ready to blaze your own path. It's risky but that's what you were built for. Play to your strengths
- To become successful, know yourself. Then apply yourself to the right pond

## Chap 2: Do nice guys finish last?

- Do people who cheat or break the rules succeed more often? Do nice guys really finish last?
- A lot of us are inclined to mistake kindness for weakness
- Sometimes, being a jerk can make others see you as more powerful. Why might jerks succee? We can learn something from them. *They're assertive about what they want and they're not afraid to let others know about what they've achieved*
- What quality do people desire most in others? Trust
- When you know and trust someone, it makes transactions smoother and faster
- Treating those around you well can lead to more success than selfishness - even if the goal is to cause mischeif
**- At the very top and bottom of the spectrum are "Givers". They are supportive. Ethical people are happier.** Cheating and being a jerk, in short term, pay off but in long term, people notice and it is not good
- **TFT succeeded because it was easy for other players to deal with. It was forgiving and it would retaliate when neccesary**
	- Don't be envious. Life isn't a zero-sum game. Just because someone else wins doesn't mean you lose
	- Don't be the first to defect. Start out nice
	- Reciprocate both cooperation and defection. If a person cheats you, don't be a matyr, fight back
	- Don't be too clever. Reputation matters, don't subvert to get a bit here and there.	

> You cooperate with me, I'll cooperate with you. You betray me, I'll betray you.

### Lessons

- Pick the right pond. Eg, take a look at coworkers
- Cooperate first. Eg, the first to offer help creates feeling of reciprocity
- Being purely selfless is silly, not saintly. Retaliation is necessary, being a saint doesn't get ahead
- Work hard, but make sure it gets noticed
- Think long term and make others think long term. The more things are one-off, the more incentive someone betrays. Good behaviour wins over in long term
- Forgive

## Chap 3: Do quitters never win and winners never quit?

- Grit is important. Pessimism results in feeling hopeless, nothing can be changed. Optimists (-> healther, luckier) feels things can be changed
- If life is all about pleasure or immediate benefits, then once they cease, we quit. But when we have meaning, we live for something greater than ourselves, we persist. Meaning comes from the stories we tell about ourselves. When our lives don't match our stories, we feel distressed
- Sometimes, quitting is the smartest choice. And giving up, when done right, can make you a huge success too
- Meaning comes from our stores. Stories can jkeep us going because some are inaccurate. Eg, optimists. Meaningful doesn't have to be saving orphans or curing the sick. As long as your story is meaningful to you, it has power
- To serve your longer-term career and life, you need to be forward-thinking about eulogy values too (in addition to resume values). To find eulogy goals, think of death

> Resume values => external success. Eulogy values => character, kindness, good, etc.

Instead of behaviour following beliefs, actually, it's beliefs following behaviours
Change the story and you change the behaviour. Games are fun stories. Why are most jobs not fun? Because it's not a fun story. Games are winnable: novel challenges, goals, feedback
**The most motivating thing is progress in meaningful work**

> Feeling of control reduces stress

- Strategic Quitting. Once you've found something you're passionate about, quitting secondary things can be an advantage because it frees up time to do that more important thing
- To be more effective, not first by scheduling but by getting rid of everything that doesn't move the needle
- Successful people do work a lot of hours. Average: 60-65 hours/week
- **Lucky people maximize opportunities, they are more open to new experiences, more extroverted, less neurotic. They just try stuff**
- **When there are no clear paths to success, no relevant models for what you're trying to achieve, trying crazy things may be the only way to solve issues**
- **If you don't know what to be gritty at yet, then try lots of things, knowing you'll quit most of them, to find the answer.** Use trying-and-quitting to find out what's not worth quitting. Applications include job hopping, positions, try stuff outside of field of expertise. 

> Have grit on the items worth pursuing, though do recognize limits. Experiment and try new things. Strategically quit after gaining understanding and feeling not worth continuing. Do this especially to find the gritty items

## Chap 4: It's not what you know, it's who you know (unless it really is what you know)

- **Dealing with others is often an important component of getting ahead**
- You don't actually need to know more to be seen as a leader. Merely by speaking first and speaking often, very extroverted behaviour, people come to be seen as the boss. To get ahead, you need to self-promote, which comes naturally to extroverts
- **Extroverts tend to be happier than introverts. In fact, when introverts pretended to be extroverts, they were happier too**
- The superpower of introverts is that they are far more likely to become experts in their field
- The rule of thumb is simple. When making friends "be socially optimistic"
- Research shows being part of several social groups vs just one increases resilience and helps overcome stress
- The biggest mistake people make when trying to get ahead at the office is opting out of social dynamics, refusing to play politics game
- Almost every successful person has had a mentor. Mentors can guide you and they can make learning fun

> Success isn't just about money and career

## Chap 5: Believe in yourself...sometimes

- Successful people consistently overrate themselves relative to their peers. Successful people are "delusional" in a good way
- Confident people believe they can succeed. And people who believe they can succeed see opportunities where others see threats
- Overconfidence leads to bad delusions and hubris, and when it meets reality, one can get one's butt beaten. It also turns one into a jerk
- When we think we know all the answers, we stop looking for them 
- **Self-compassion leads to better results than self-esteem**
- Confidence is a result of success, not a cause. The surest way to become confident is to become really good at something
- It is not always the people who start out the smartest who end up the smartest 

## Chap 6: Work, work, work...or work-life balance
 
- Success is not for the lazy, procrastinating, or mercurial
- Voluminous productivity is the rule and not the exception among individuals who have made some noteworthy contributions
- Those who stayed very involved in meaningful careers (which they found competent and important) and worked the hardest also lived the longest
- **Social connection is the greatest predictor of happiness.** Unchecked, getting those 10,000 hours can lead us to a dark place and is a Faustian agreement
- What if working super hard and still not winning? There are physical limits to # of hours working. Then, be creative, outside-the-box, cartwheels, fun

> We love having choices. We hate making choices

- **We need a personal definition of success. Looking around you to see if you're succeeding is no longer a realistic option**
- Evaluating life based on one metric turns out to be a key problem. **One yardstick isn't enough. Many yardsticks are needed.**
- Without a plan, we do what's passive and easy, not what is really fulfilling
- Having clarity on goals and expectations reduces stress
- **Success comes in different forms. It's really about aligning who you are and where you choose to be**
