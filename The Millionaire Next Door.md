# The Millionaire Next Door

- "Wealth is not the same as income. If you make a good income each year and split it all, you are not getting wealthier, you're just living high"
- "Wealth is often the result of a lifestyle of **hardwork**, **perseverance**, **planning**, and, most of all, **self-discipline.**"
- 80% of millionaires are first-generation rich. Common denominators among those who build wealth: 
	- They live well below their means
	- They allocate time, energy, and money towards ways related to building wealth
	- Financial independence is more important than high social status
	- Good at targeting market opportunities
	- Choose the right occupation
	
## Frugal, Frugal, Frugal

- **"Allocating time and money in the pursuit of looking superior often has a predictable outcome: inferior economic achievement"**
- "Being frugal is the cornerstone of wealth-building"
- Most millionaires don't wear expensive clothing or footware
- Have good offense (income-generation) and defense (frugal spending)
- Millionaires budget and control their expenses to stay rich
- Financially independent people are happier than those who aren't
- "Small amounts invested periodically also become large investments over time"
- **Note: income tax is tax on income, not on wealth or appreciation of wealth**
- "The average American millionaire has an income that represents less than 10% of net worth. In spite of having a lot of wealth, they may be personally cash poor."
- Once you're in a high income bracket, eg, $100,000 or $200,000, what you do with what you have matters more than what you make. For the purpose of wealth making, income doesn't matter that much

> "Most people who become millionaires have confidence in their own abilities"

> Be frugal

> Recognize the relationship between realized income and wealth

- Being an educated high-income earner doesn't automatically translate into financial independence. It takes planning and sacrifice
- It is easier to accumulate wealth if you don't live in a high-status neighbourhood (because would need more income and more taxes)

## Time, Energy, and Money

- Prodigious accumulators of wealth (PAW) allocate twice more time to investments than under-accumulators of wealth (UAW)
- PAW tend to worry less about income than UAW because income is a small portion of their wealth
- "Employees are too often fully dependent on their employers"
- UAWs tend to have more liquid investments (eg, cash, short-term bills). PAWs tend to invest in categories that appreciate in value but don't create realized income
- Only 9% of millionaires hold stocks for less than one year. Most hold for a long time. Buy and hold, rather than short-term

> Put time into learning investments

## You Aren't What You Drive

- Usually, PAWs love working, whereas UAWs work because they have to support their consumption habit
- Many status artifacts, such as luxury cars, are burdens
- It's better to purchase expensive items after becoming wealthy rather than purchase them in anticipation of becoming wealthy 

## Economic Outpatient Care

- It's generally not a good idea to provide independent adult children free money, which some affluent families do. This likely creates over-dependence, UAWs, and other problems
- It's okay to provide for tuition (education). Actually, this is a good idea. It's important to cultivate an environment that honours independent thoughts and achievements, and rewards responsibility & leadership
- Don't weaken the weak. Help them improve
- "The more money adult children receive, the fewer money they accumulate, while those who are given fewer money accumulate more"
- **People often attempt to shelter their children from the economic realities of life. But such shelters often produce adults who are in constant fear of tomorrow**

## Affirmative Action, Family Style

- **UAWs tend to emphasize their income, consumption habits, and status artifacts. PAWs tend to speak about their achievements**
- "If you're wealthy and want your children to become happy and independent, minimize talking about receiving other people's money as gifts"
- **Most PAWs have close long-term relationships with several key professions**
- Tips for raising children:
	1. Don't tell them that you're very wealthy
	2. No matter how wealthy you are, teach children discipline and frugality
	3. Never give cash or other gifts to children as part of a negotiation
	4. **Tell your children that there are a lot of things more valuable than money: good health, happiness, loving family, fine friends, achievements, etc.**
	
## Find Your Niche
- Very often, those who supply the affluent become wealthy themselves. Eg, tax, immigration, estate attorneys, healthcare, appraisers, private educaiton

## Jobs: Millionaires vs Heirs
- Most of the affluent in America are business owners
- "Their capital is their intellect"
- Interesting. **What is risk? Being an entrepreneur"; "What is risk? Having one source of income"**
- "PAWs need to achieve, to create wealth, to become financially independent, to build something from scratch. UAWs more often need to display a high-status lifestyle"
