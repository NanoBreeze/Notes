# Coursera - The Science of Wellbeing (Happiness Course)

## Week 2: Misconceptions about Happiness

- Things we think will make us happy but don't:
	- Just getting a good job
	- Money. Once your needs are met, money has negligible effect. EWB at around $75,000. After that, money doesn't make much difference for increasing happiness
	- A lot of stuff doesn't make us as happy as we think. Materialists had lower life satisfaction vs non-materialists 20 years later. Materialists also had more mental health disorders
	- Married people are happier in the 1-2 years before and after marriage, but after that, married = unmarried
	- After weight loss and cosmetic surgery, negative measures actually got worse. Looks like beauty doesn't make us happier
- **We can work to become happier but we tend ot be working in the wrong direction, putting time into things that actually won't make us much happier**. eg, prestigious job, stuff, beauty, etc.
- *Most of the goals we think will make us happy don't really make us as happy as we want!*

> For materialists, you wanted all this stuff. YOu had 20 years to get it but you're still not happy

> "Our minds' strongest intuitions about what will make us happy are often wrong" Eg, prestigious job, lots of money, awesome stuff, true love, perfect body, perfect grades, etc.

## Week 3: Why our expectations are so bad

<ins>Miswanting</ins>: being mistaken about how much we'll like something in the future. Why does miswanting occur? Because of four annoying features of our minds: 
1. Our mind's strongest intuitions are often wrong, especially about happiness. Eg, optical illusions
2. Our minds don't think in absolutions. They judge **relative to reference points** - salient (but often irrelevant) standard against which all subsequent information is compared. Eg, Olympics. Are we judging our happiness and events relative to other things? Do reference points also affect happines sjudgement in daily life?
	- Reference 1) Past. Eg, money we used to make
	- Reference 2) Others. We care a lot about where we stand relative to others even more than our own absolute level
		- one would assume that **if our minds use reference points, they would at least use reasonable ones, but it turns out they don't**. As a result, there's social comparison with jobs, grades, money, stuff, body, etc.
3. **Hedonic adaptation**. Our minds are built to get used to stuff
	- Hedonic adaptation: getting adapted to positive and negative stimuli such that emotional effects are attenuated over time
4. **Impact bias**: we don't tend to realize our minds is built to get used to stuff. That initial level of happiness naturally will decrease. We overestimate **intensity + duration** because of: 
	- Focalism, only looking at that one thing, need to look at surrounding events
	- Immune Neglect, we have psychological immune system
	
## Week 4: How can we overcome our biases

- Need to intentionally work to overcome bias, and our mind may initially resist
- How to get over getting used to stuff (hedonic adaptation)?
	- Don't expect happiness to come from stuff, since stuff is static. **If you're going to spend money to be happy, don't buy stuff, buy experiences. At every income level, experiential purchases make us happier than material ones**, especially at higher incomes
	- Experiences are less susceptible to social comparisons
	
> Investing in experiences makes us happier than investing in stuff. We don't think adapt as quickly. Rething "awesome stuff"

Other ways to thwart hedonic adaptation:
	- savour - appreciate the current experience. This will cause initial happiness to start higher so it takes longer to adapt and leads us to focus on the experience longer
		- Eg, talk to another person, think, present, thought about sharing
		- What reduced savouring: focusing on future, reminding ourselves it will be over, thinking of ways it could be better, getting out of the moment, social comparison, thinking we don't deserve it
	- Negative visualization: think of what things would have been like if they didn't go that way
	- Make this day your last: pretend you're leaving soon
	- Grateful: write down what we're grateful for. Affect things to other parts of our lives

How do we reset our reference points - salient (but often irrelevant) standard against which subsequent information is compared:
	- Concretely re-experience what previous reference points felt like
	- Concretely observe the alternatives. Eg, visiting Harvard when you're at Yale
	- Avoid social comparisons
	- Interrupt the activity, eg, while listening to songs
	
## Week 5: Stuff that makes us happy

- Miswanting happens because of biases that mess up our desires (annoying features of the mind)
- Are there things we should be wanting that we don't realize? Yes!
	1) Wanting the right parts of what we already want 
	2) Wanting better stuff that we don't want yet
	
<ins>Right Wants</ins>

- "Good job": what factors should we actually be wanting in a job?
	- <ins>activate signature strengths</ins>: strengths that we do best and feel ourselves flourishing. Higher use of signature strengths at work = higher productivity + higher job satisfaction
	- <ins>increase flow</ins>: high challenge & high skills. Choose challenging but attainable goals, strong focused concentration, intrinsically rewarding
- "Good grades": it turns out that extrinsic motivation might steal from intrinsic motivation, causing people to enjoy the activity less. Getting that good grade can strip away the love of learning, if left unchecked. 
	- can also limit growth mindset. Fixed mindset: brainwave attuned to right/wrong. Growth mindset: brainwave shows more attention to correct answer/solution
	- <ins>aim for learning outcome</ins>
	
<ins> Wanting better things</ins>

1. Acts of kindness actually increases happiness. Eg, buying things for others
2. **Social Connection**: just being around other people makes us happy. This is the opposite of loneliness. Connectedness matters
	- People with close social ties are more likely to live longer, less likely to fall prey to stressful events, etc.
	- Even connections with strangers make us feel happier. Just being around someone makes us feel better. eg, chocolate. 
	- Happy people tend to rate themselves higher in terms of social connections than unhappy people
3. **Time Affluence**: have time to do the stuff you want; you don't feel strapped for time. 
	- People who value/prioritize time over money were happier!
4. **Mind Control**: controlling our own minds to not think all over the place all over the time
	- "Mind-wandering"; "a shift in the contents of thought away from an ongoing task or from events in the external environment to self-generated thoughts and feelings". eg, ruminating about the past, thinking about dinner, etc.
	- People mind-wander a lot. 30% of the time in almost all activities (except sex ;p) and it has a negative impact on happiness
	- How to turn off "mind-wandering"? With meditation: *"practice of turning your attention away from distracting thoughts toward a single point of reference (eg, breathing, a thought, etc."*
		- Meditation increases positive emotions, increases gray matters, more sociability, more kindness
		- *"The effects of meditation go beyond just the moments when we meditate. It also changes our baseline"*
5. **Healthy Practice**
	- Exercise, fitness also increases cognitive performance
	- Sleep, more happiness. Deprived sleep causes more emotional and physical complaints. Having enough sleep also increases cognitive performance, and less sleep causes lower performance
	- Best of all, these are all FREE!
