# The Myths of Happiness

- We tend to **overestimate how long + intense good and bad events are.** We exaggerate the effect of a life change on our happiness because we don't foresee other details
- Intuition doesn't always work. **Replace reliance on happiness myths with a prepared mind.** We have underlying assumptions that aren't true, incorrect expectations

## Chap 1: I'll be happy when ... I'm married to the right person

- "Even the happiest marriages can't maintain their initial satisfaction level without a great deal of energy and commitment
- Passionate love (allows pairing up) -> Compassionate love (nourish stable partnership to reproduce and let children survive). Evolutionary reasons
- **Not all changes are equal to hedonic adaptation. Dynamic changes (eg, new class, making a friend) are less adaptable than unchanging ones (eg, new apartment, securing a loan)**
	- Add variety, surprises, novelty to minimize adaptation
- Reduced sexual passion doesn't mean something is wrong with our relationship. It's just a symptom of normal process of adaptation
- Dissatisfaction comes from hedonic adaptation
- How to be a good partner?
	1. Making the most of partner's good news (eg, congratulate on promotion). Not saying anything is negative and unsupportive
	2. Supporting partner's values, goals, and dreams
	3. Touch (eg, hug, stroking, kiss, pat)
	
> hedonic adaptation: adapt and get used to it

## Chap 5: I'll be happy when ... I find the right job

- Like marriage, we can hedonically adapt to our work. **Identify how much of our frustration is to our unique work situation and how much to hedonic adaptation**
- Because experience less pleasure over time and aspirations rise ("new normal")
- **Immoderate aspirations are toxic to happiness**. THe more we attain, the more we want, which can negate the increased happiness
- Ways to rein in aspiration:
	- Re-experience what it was like in a worse job (mentally teleport)
	- Gratitude
	- Proper reference point
	- Pretend this is your last day before moving away
	
> excessive inflation of expectations

- Having high goals and expectations improve human performance. How to reconcile this with lowering aspirations? We can have more appreciation and not less performance on specific tasks. **We can aspire to go higher without feeling inferior, while still feeling happy**
- We have more control over how we view the future than the past
- It's not really good that we ask *"how good is my career, productivity, and income <ins>compared with my neighbour's</ins>?* instead of asking *"does my career meet my needs?"*. **The solution isn't to ignore others' strengths/accomplishments, it's to not suffer in these comparisons.**
- Happy people are less swayed by comparison than unhappy people. Conversely, if we rely on our own internal standards, we are happiest; if we rely on comparisons with others, we become least happy
- Simply striving for a goal (not necessarily achieving it) will make us happier, especially when the goal is realistic, flexible, authentic, not materialistic, and doesn't negatively impact other parts of our lives

## Chap 6: I can't be happy when ... I'm broke

- Income and happiness are correlated but the correlation isn't super strong
	- wealth makes us happy when we're thinking about our lives but money has a smaller impact on our feeling as we live it day to day
	- Correlation between money and happiness is stronger among poorer people than richer ones
- Spend money on experiences, be thrifty, buy more smaller things than one large one

> Pain is more potent than pleasure

## Chap 7: I'll be happy when ... I'm richer

- "There are those moments when we have finally reached our goals - especially with regards to making money - and the often unexpected turmoil follows. Why? Because we fell prey to the assumption that once we've attained wealth or success, we'd finally be happy, and when that happiness is short-lived, we feel mixed emotions, letdown, and even depression"
- There are very few things in life that are what they're hyped up to be
- We tend to get used to what we have. Eg, higher standard of living, more money
- **The pursuit of money and reputation redirects our energy and passions away from deeper meaningful social connections and growth, and prevents us from achieving our full potential**
- Happiness with money tips:
	1. Spend money on need-satisfying activities. Eg, relationships, growth, etc.
	2. Spending money on others can make us happy
	3. Spend money to make time
	4. Spend money, but enjoy it later. Anticipation of good events can cause happiness
	
## Chap 10: I can't be happy when ... the best years of my life are over

- Fallacy that we can judge the best years of our lives. Second fallacy is the myth that the younger we are, the happier
- Rosy recollection: we tend to recall past events more fondly than they really were
- <ins>Endowment vs contrast</ins>: 
	- happy people tend to extract pleasure from recollecting past events (eg, achievements, love) whereas unhappy people are endowed in negative ents (eg, illness, disappointment, petty hurts)
	- happy people contrast past negative events with here & now (eg, "My life is much better now") whereas unhappy people contrast the present with past positive events (eg, "life used to be more exciting"), which is also what happens when we think the best years of our lives is over
	
	> 1. The outcome isn't known. 2. How we remember past events impacts our current happiness
	
	- Use memories to enhance rather than detract from well-being
	
- **Replay happy moments, analyze unhappy ones**
- Older people are happier with their lives than younger people

> "Focus on the future rather than dwell on the past"

> Believing in these 'happiness myths' can have bad consequences. We must stop waiting for happiness
